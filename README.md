Memory Game:
A memory game is a popular type of game that challenges players to match pairs of cards or tiles by flipping them over. The game typically consists of a grid of facedown cards or tiles, each containing an image or symbol. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, aiming to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up, and the player earns points. If not, the cards are flipped back face down, and the player tries again. The objective is to remember the positions of the cards and make as many matches as possible within a given time limit or number of moves. Memory games are often enjoyed for their simplicity, accessibility, and ability to test and improve memory, concentration, and cognitive skills.
